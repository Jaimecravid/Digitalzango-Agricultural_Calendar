# Error Handling and Troubleshooting

- If stuck with persistent errors, use alternative AI models (e.g., ChatGPT 4.0) for debugging.  
- Provide clear code snippets, goals, and error messages for assistance.  
- Break down complex problems into smaller parts to isolate issues.  
- Keep backups or commits before major changes to enable rollback.
