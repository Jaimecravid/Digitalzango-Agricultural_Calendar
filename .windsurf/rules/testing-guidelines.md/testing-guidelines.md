# Testing Guidelines

- Keep the app running and test new features immediately after implementation.  
- Use unit tests or manual testing to verify each feature works as expected.  
- Use image uploads or UI references when debugging or designing interfaces.  
- Ensure no existing functionality is broken by new changes.
