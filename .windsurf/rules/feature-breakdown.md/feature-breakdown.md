# Feature Breakdown and Development Process

- Split the project into small, manageable features or tasks.  
- Build and complete one feature fully before starting the next.  
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving on.  
- Commit changes regularly after each feature is done.  
- Avoid combining multiple features in one task.
